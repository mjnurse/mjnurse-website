NAME
    goto - quickly navigate to frequently used directories

USAGE
    goto [options] [<directory-name-details>]

OPTIONS
    -a|--add <directory-name-details>
        Add directory(s) to the list of saved directories. All directories which have a name which starts
        with the provided details will be added.

    -e|--edit
        Edit the list of save directories.

    -r|--redirection
        Output the commands to change the current directory to the a directory selected in the previous
        run of goto, and list its contents.

    -h|--help
        Show help text.

DESCRIPTION
    Navigate to frequently used directories by matching the provided directory name details against a list
    of saved directories. The list of saved directories is stored in a file named goto.dat in the same
    directory as the goto script. Each line in the file should contain a directory name and its corresponding
    path, separated by a comma.

    Calling goto without any arguments will display the contents of goto.dat and indicate if any paths are
    invalid directories. 

    When the script is run with a directory name details argument, it searches the goto.dat file for matches.
    If there is a single match, it outputs the corresponding path. If there are multiple matches, it lists
    them and prompts the user to select one.

    As you cannot change the current directory of a parent process, this script needs to be called from a
    function. The function is called in two parts: the first part calls goto with the directory name details,
    and the second part evaluates the output of goto -r to change the current directory.

    g () {
        goto -s "$1"
        eval "$(goto -r)"
    }
